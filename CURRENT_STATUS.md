# Current Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **MCP Server (Deployed)**
   - URL: https://appdemo.oskarcode.com/mcp/*
   - Tools available: 6 tools for presentation management
   - Can be tested directly with curl

2. **Django Backend**
   - Database: PresentationSection model
   - API: REST endpoints for sections
   - Dynamic content rendering

3. **Presentation Page**
   - Dynamic template
   - Renders from database
   - Chat widget UI installed

4. **Claude API**
   - API key configured
   - Works with standard models
   - SSL issues resolved

## ⚠️ What's Not Working

**MCP Connector Beta**
- Error: HTTP 404/400 from Anthropic API
- The `client.beta.messages.create()` with `mcp_servers` parameter fails
- The beta feature `mcp-client-2025-04-04` might not be available yet

## 🎯 Current Situation

The code is written to use MCP Connector (the proper way), but the Anthropic API returns:
```
HTTP 404: /v1/messages?beta=true
HTTP 400: Bad Request with mcp_servers parameter
```

## 💡 Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Local Tool Execution (Temporary)
Revert to having Django execute tools directly:
- Works immediately
- Doesn't use deployed MCP server
- Same functionality, different architecture

### Solution 2: Wait for MCP Connector Access
- MCP Connector might be in limited preview
- May need to request beta access from Anthropic
- Or use a different API key with beta access

### Solution 3: Use Standard MCP Protocol
- Build custom MCP client in Django
- Connect to MCP server ourselves
- More complex but gives us full control

## 📊 Architecture Comparison

### Current (MCP Connector - Not Working)
```
User → Django → Claude API (with MCP Connector)
                     ↓ [FAILS HERE - 404/400]
               MCP Server
```

### Alternative (Local Tools - Works)
```
User → Django → Claude API (with local tools)
            ↓
       Execute tools directly
            ↓
       Database updates
```

## 🚀 Recommendation

For immediate functionality:
1. **Revert to local tools** (5 min fix)
2. **Test everything works end-to-end**
3. **Keep MCP server deployed** for future use
4. **Revisit MCP Connector** when beta is widely available

The deployed MCP server can still be:
- Used by Claude Desktop
- Called directly via API
- Tested with MCP Inspector
- Ready for when MCP Connector becomes available

## 📝 Next Steps

**Want me to:**
1. Revert to working local tools version?
2. Test the full flow end-to-end?
3. Create documentation for both approaches?
