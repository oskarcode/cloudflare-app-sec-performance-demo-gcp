## 🛡️ Common Objections & Responses

### **Objection 1: "We already have a CDN"**

**Response:**  
> "That's great! The question is: Are you paying per-GB for bandwidth? Most CDNs charge usage fees. Cloudflare includes unlimited bandwidth in every plan. Plus, you get integrated security - WAF, DDoS, Bot Management - that other CDNs charge extra for or don't offer at all."

---

### **Objection 2: "This sounds too good to be true"**

**Response:**  
> "I understand the skepticism! Here's why it works: Cloudflare operates at massive scale - we serve over 20% of all web traffic globally. This scale allows us to offer unlimited bandwidth economically. Our business model is based on flat-rate pricing, not per-GB fees. Plus, we have over 5 million customers proving this works, including [mention relevant e-commerce brands]."

---

### **Objection 3: "We need to evaluate other options"**

**Response:**  
> "Absolutely, due diligence is important. May I ask what other options you're considering? [Listen] Here's what makes Cloudflare unique: FREE unlimited bandwidth (most charge per-GB), integrated security (not bolted on), and < 30 minute setup (DNS change only). What specific criteria are you evaluating?"

---

### **Objection 4: "We need IT/Security team approval"**

**Response:**  
> "Perfect! I'd love to include them. Cloudflare is extremely popular with technical teams because: 1) It's a simple DNS change, 2) No code changes required, 3) We provide detailed documentation, and 4) 24/7 support. Would it make sense to schedule a technical deep-dive call with them?"

---

### **Objection 5: "What if it doesn't work?"**

**Response:**  
> "Great question. First, Cloudflare has a [X-day] money-back guarantee. Second, because it's just a DNS change, you can switch back instantly if needed - though I've never seen that happen. Third, we can start with a test domain or subset of traffic to prove value before full migration. Would a pilot approach make you more comfortable?"
